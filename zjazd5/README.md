# Neural networks

Authors: Zuzanna Ciborowska s20682 & Joanna Walkiewicz s20161
This repository contain 4 different python project:

- CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD.py - cheking if credit card transaction was fraud using neural network with 1 and 3 layers, result can be find in files card_transactions_1_layer.png and card_transactions_3_layers.png. In file comparing.png the resuls are checked with SVM classificator results

- CIFAR10.py - recognition of animals from the CIFAR collection using neural networks, results can be find in cifar.png file and confussion_matrix_for_cifar.png

- fashion.py - clothing recognition using neural networks, results can be find in fashion.png file

- HORSE_OR_HUMAN.py - a program to recognize whether there is a human or a horse in the picture using neural networks, result can be find in horse_or_human.png file

Dataset for CREDIT_CARD_FRAUD.py can be found in repository
