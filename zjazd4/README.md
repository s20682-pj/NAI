# Classification

Authors: Zuzanna Ciborowska s20682 & Joanna Walkiewicz s20161
Python project to create decision tree and svm classificator for Pima Indians Diabetes
and Card Fraud Transactions Dataset

Datasets can be found:
- [Pima Indians Diabetes](https://machinelearningmastery.com/standard-machine-learning-datasets/)

- [Card Fraud Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud)

File with Card Transactions used in the example has been shortened to reduce the program's running time


To run the reccomender please install:

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- Pandas
```bash
pip install pandas
```

- Pydotplus
```bash
pip install pydotplus
```

- IPython
```bash
pip install ipython
```

- Sckit-learn
```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

- Graphviz
```bash
pip install graphviz
```


The results of a sample runs of the program can be found in the files:

- diabetes.png - decision tree for Pima Indians Diabetes dataset

- fraud.png - decision tree for Card Fraud Transactions dataset 

- svm results.png - SVM classificator results for both datasets
